# Adventure-Roll

Adventure Roll is a system of movement of the human body based primarily on the martial arts.  It is intended for physical and mental exercise, and to strengthen ones ability to interact with the physical world.  

I will now list sources along with major contributions:

 - judo: falls, rolls, hip throws, gripping, foot sweep/block and timing, crunch arm bar, count in Japanese
 
 - BJJ: guard pull, RNC, collar choke/control, positional control/transitions(e.g.sweeps), triangle choke, taijiquan like slow motions across the mat, upright butt scoot, get up in base,
  
 - Taekwondo: side kick and front kick to knee, stretch kicks for flexibility, front kick, rapid chambered punches for cardio, distance control to avoid punches and stay in kick range, count in Korean
 
 - boxing: jab-cross from a block position with footwork
 
 - wrestling: double leg takedown, Granby rolls, spins 
 
 - taijiquan: slow movements, motions with qi ball
 
 - skateboarding: curb and steps interactions, being one with the pavement, slide motions on surfaces, slowly flopping down a series of steps(combine with tajiquan)
 
 - wushu: working on things from horse stance, manipulation of a 2 meter stick in space, count in Mandarin
 
 - kali/escrima: basic stick/knife motions(1,2,3,4) as an exercise in control of muscles in space, train to use these motions in industrial production with other tools
 
 These can all go on a dodecahedron, which I will now commence to make. right now it's 9 elements but if i break 3 of them by 2x it's 12.  the three grappling systems get broken up into stand up and ground work and it's 12.
